    <p>Luna is a fluffy white cat who loves to nap in the window and chase laser dots.

    <h2>Her Favorite Things:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Sleeping on soft blankets</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Luna’s favorite spot in the house is on a soft, fluffy blanket by the window. She curls up like a cinnamon roll and snoozes for hours! </p>

    <p>Sometimes she kneads the blanket like it's dough before she settles in — it's her bedtime routine.
    </p>

    <p>When the blanket is warm from the sun, Luna gets extra cozy. She even growls a little if anyone tries to move her. Yes, it's *her* blanket now!
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Chasing Birds</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Luna loves chasing birds! Every morning, she sits by the window, eyes wide and tail flicking.When she sees a bird outside, she makes funny little chirping sounds and jumps at the glass!</p>

    <p>Her favorite targets are the quick little sparrows. Don’t worry — she never catches them, but she loves the game!
